# NLU-1
This repository contains my solution for the first assignment of the NLU course.


# Requirements
In order to run this Jupyter Notebook is necessary to have installed Spacy.
To do so:
- pip install spacy
- python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm (to install English models)

If this doesn't work pleas check the Spacy documentation -> https://spacy.io/usage
